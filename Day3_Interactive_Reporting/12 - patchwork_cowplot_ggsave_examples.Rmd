```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(cowplot)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## 📊 Create Example Plots

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Bill Length by Species")

p2 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, fill = species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Flipper Length Density")
```

## 🔗 Combine with Patchwork

```{r}
patchwork_plot <- p1 / p2 + 
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")
patchwork_plot
```

## 🐮 Combine with Cowplot



```{r}
cowplot_plot <- plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c("A", "B"), ncol = 1)
cowplot_plot
```

## 💾 Save with ggsave in Different Formats and DPI

```{r save-ggsave, eval=FALSE}
# Save the patchwork plot as PNG
ggsave("patchwork_plot.png", patchwork_plot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)

# Save the cowplot version as PDF
ggsave("cowplot_plot.pdf", cowplot_plot, width = 8, height = 10)

# Save as JPEG with different DPI
ggsave("patchwork_plot_highdpi.jpeg", patchwork_plot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 600)
```
